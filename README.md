This is a small repo where I store solutions to the [L-99: Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html). Solutions in CL are available [elsewhere](https://www.informatimago.com/develop/lisp/l99/).

I may add a `raco`-based testing framework later on. By this time, all files include their own testing function, and you should be able to run each one from an REPL (e.g., `,enter p01.rkt`) or using `racket` from your preferred shell.
